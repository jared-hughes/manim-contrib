# Manim Contrib

A collection of example mobjects/scenes to serve as examples and starting points for using [Manim CE](https://www.manim.community/).

Check out https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/examples.html for curated examples of Manim in action. This repository intends to have a wider scope: essentially any mobject or scenes that may be helpful to others.

Based on https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/issues/914.

## Contributions

Please send in your own mobjects and scenes as a pull request! Make sure to include at minimum:

- A Python file with a runnable scene
- A screenshot of the scene, or a video if necessary
